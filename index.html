      <p>I am from Lawton, Oklahoma. I attended the University of Oklahoma for my undergraduate degree. I obtained a
        Bachelor of Science
        in 2010 specalizing in Multidisciplinary Studies: Technical Sciences. In that time, I began to study base
        elements of Solidworks
        and Java. This is where my love of technology and software began to grow. After I departed from the University
        of Oklahoma, I moved to
        Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to begin my career. I started in the oil & gas industry as an independent landman. This
        was very enjoyable,
        and I found the work very satisfying, as well.
        <br>
        I moved to Denver, Colorado in March of 2013. I made the move for a number of reasons. Most important being that
        I had landed a new
        job working for Garlock Pipeline Technologies in Wheatridge, Colorado. Currently I am working for a solar
        company called Blue Raven.
        In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, distance running, skiing, riding my bike,
        experiencing live music,
        camping, reading, yoga, and traveling.
